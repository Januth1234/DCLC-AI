# DCLC Usage Policy

## 18+ Only — Consent

**This model and all related data, code, and outputs are 18+ only.**

By **using, downloading, or interacting with DCLC in any way**, you confirm that:

1. You are **18 years of age or older** (or the age of majority where you live).
2. You **consent** to being exposed to adult and explicit content.

## Content Policy

DCLC does not restrict content. By default it can generate **nudity, adult content, and violence or crime scenes** (e.g. crime scene imagery or descriptions). There is no built-in content filter on the model. Image generation and edit outputs are **never filtered**; only text can optionally be filtered in the app when "Good mode" is ON. Training uses explicit data sources (see docs/RAW_TRAINING.md and docs/EXPLICIT_SOURCES_REQUIRED.md).

- **Unfiltered mode (default)**: All prompts and outputs allowed. Nudes, crime scenes, and explicit content are permitted.
- **Filtered mode**: Optional. User enables in Settings (Good mode). Applies only to text; images are never filtered.

All data sources, documentation, and outputs in this repository are **18+**. By using DCLC, you acknowledge that you are responsible for your use and for complying with applicable laws. The model may generate nudity, violence, and explicit content.

## Filter Toggle

- **OFF (default)**: Unfiltered. Raw model output.
- **ON**: Optional filter active. User enables in Settings (Good mode).

## User Responsibility
