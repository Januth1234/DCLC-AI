# DCLC Usage Policy

## Content Policy

DCLC does not restrict content. By default it can generate **nudity, adult content, and violence or crime scenes** (e.g. crime scene imagery or descriptions) when prompted. There is no built-in content filter on the model. Image generation and edit outputs are **never filtered**; only text can optionally be filtered in the app when "Good mode" is ON. Training can include uncensored data (see docs/RAW_TRAINING.md).

- **Unfiltered mode (default)**: All prompts and outputs allowed. Nudes, crime scenes, and explicit content are permitted.
- **Filtered mode**: Optional. User enables in Settings (Good mode). Applies only to text; images are never filtered.

By using DCLC, you acknowledge that you are responsible for your use of the model and its outputs, including compliance with applicable laws in your jurisdiction. The model may generate nudity, violence, and explicit content.

## Filter Toggle

- **OFF (default)**: Unfiltered. Raw model output.
- **ON**: Optional filter active. User enables in Settings.

## User Responsibility

Users assume full responsibility for their use of DCLC and for complying with applicable laws. The authors provide the model "as is" without warranties.
